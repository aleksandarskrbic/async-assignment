The assignment is about finishing the implementation of the `io.oriel.Async`
data type.

1. see [io.oriel.Async](./src/main/java/io/oriel/Async.java)
2. read the source code already in place
3. implement the functions marked with `throw UnsupportedOperationException`
4. make sure the tests are passing, see [AsyncTests](./src/test/java/io/oriel/AsyncTests.java)

Tests are provided, to run the tests suite:

```
$ mvn test
